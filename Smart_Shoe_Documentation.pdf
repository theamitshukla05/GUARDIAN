🧠 SMART SHOES – IoT-ENABLED WEARABLE SYSTEM FOR SAFETY AND HEALTH MONITORING
🧾 1. ABSTRACT

This project presents the design and development of Smart Shoes, an IoT-enabled wearable system aimed at enhancing safety, mobility, and health monitoring. The proposed design integrates three main modules — Location Tracking, Obstacle Detection, and Health Monitoring — all powered by the ESP32 microcontroller.
The system can track the user’s location in real-time, detect obstacles for visually impaired users, and monitor foot temperature and pressure for diabetic patients. Data is displayed on a cloud-based IoT dashboard (Blynk or Firebase). The solution is affordable, compact, and rechargeable, making it practical for real-world use.

⚙️ 2. OBJECTIVES

To develop a smart shoe that can track location in real-time using GPS and Wi-Fi.

To provide obstacle detection alerts for visually impaired individuals.

To monitor health parameters like temperature and pressure for diabetic users.

To design a low-cost, portable, and rechargeable prototype.

To demonstrate IoT connectivity using Blynk or Firebase platforms.

🔍 3. INTRODUCTION

Smart wearable technology is revolutionizing the healthcare and safety domains. Footwear plays a key role in human movement, and embedding smart sensors into shoes allows constant monitoring of environmental and physiological conditions.
This Smart Shoe integrates IoT, sensing, and alert systems to create a versatile device that improves safety for the visually impaired, enables real-time tracking for faculty or patients, and supports diabetic foot comfort and monitoring.

🧩 4. SYSTEM MODULES
🗺️ Module 1: Location Tracking

Components: ESP32 Microcontroller, Neo-6M GPS Module

Function: Continuously fetches GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) and transmits them to the IoT dashboard using Wi-Fi.

Platform Used: Blynk IoT (for live map display) or Firebase + Google Maps API.

Working:

GPS collects location data.

ESP32 sends this data to the cloud via Wi-Fi.

The dashboard displays the shoe’s real-time position on a map.

🚨 Module 2: Obstacle Detection

Components: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, Buzzer, Vibration Motor

Function: Detects obstacles and alerts the user through sound or vibration.

Working:

Ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an object.

If distance < threshold (e.g., 50 cm), buzzer or vibration motor activates.

Prevents collisions and increases user awareness.

🦶 Module 3: Diabetic Foot Monitoring

Components: DHT11 Temperature Sensor, FSR 402 Pressure Sensor, Memory Foam Padding

Function: Measures temperature and pressure on the foot, detecting signs of swelling or inflammation.

Working:

Sensors continuously measure foot parameters.

If abnormal values are detected, the ESP32 triggers an alert on the IoT dashboard.

Enhances diabetic care and comfort.

Step 1: Component Placement

Fix the ESP32 + GPS module in a small plastic case on the shoe’s side.

Mount the Ultrasonic sensor at the toe/front area for forward obstacle detection.

Place the vibration motor near the heel or ankle for maximum tactile feedback.

Position temperature and pressure sensors under the insole (inside the shoe).

Step 2: Wiring and Connections

Connect all components using thin, flexible jumper wires.

Ensure insulation to avoid short circuits.

Route the wires neatly along the shoe’s edges.

Step 3: Circuit Integration

Assemble connections on a small Zero PCB or mini breadboard.

Power the setup with the Li-ion battery through a TP4056 charging circuit.

Add a small on/off toggle switch for power control.

Step 4: Testing & Calibration

Power ON the shoe.

Test GPS data transmission on Blynk map widget.

Place an obstacle in front of the ultrasonic sensor to verify buzzer/vibration response.

Check temperature and pressure values on the dashboard.

Step 5: Final Enclosure & Finishing

Place all modules inside the enclosure.

Add foam or padding to protect components and maintain comfort.

Use fabric glue or stitching to secure the system to the shoe base.

Workflow:

Initialize sensors and GPS.

Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi network.

Continuously read sensor and GPS data.

Send real-time data to Blynk dashboard.

Trigger alerts when threshold values are crossed.
